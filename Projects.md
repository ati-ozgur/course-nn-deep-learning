# Projects

You may choose following projects.


1. Implement a recent research paper.
    - You need to implement it in a different framework than available code. If available code is in keras, you can implement using pytorch or gluon mxnet.
    - You need to repeat the experiments and note the different results between the paper and your output code
    - You will write a report that summarizes paper and its contributions.
    - In the same report, you will note the difficulties you encountered.
    - You will present your paper and results.

Always check the paper with me.
And inform me about your paper of choice via email.

2. Enter a Kaggle competition. Kaggle competition you enter should not be a getting started or example competition.
