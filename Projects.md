# Projects

You may choose following projects.


1. Implement a recent research paper.
    - You need to implement it in a different framework than available code. If available code is in keras, you can implement using pytorch or gluon mxnet.
    - You need to repeat the experiments and note the different results between the paper and your output code
    - You will write a report that summarizes paper and its contributions.
    - In the same report, you will note the difficulties you encountered.
    - You will present your paper and results.

Always check the paper with me.
And inform me about your paper of choice via email.

2. Enter a Kaggle competition. Kaggle competition you enter should not be a getting started or example competition. 


3. You can use interesting Kaggle Dataset or any other dataset.
Check with me.

1. Introduction
    1. Team members
    2. What team members did for project
2. Problem Description
3. Dataset Description

    1. Where to download
    2. Any preprocessing
    3. problems encountered???
4. Neural Network Architecture used

    1. If any known architecture used reference it.
    2. if your own trial, explain a bit.
    3. you can use visualization of NN in this part too.
5. Training testing results
