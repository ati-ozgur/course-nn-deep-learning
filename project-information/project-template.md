Give examples


2.2 Why team members are interested in this project (optional)

Why did you choose this project.
every team members should write 1-2 sentences for themselves.

3. Dataset information

3.1 Dataset explanation

Paraphrase information given in the project page in your own words.

3.2 Dataset visualization

3.3 Example images/data from dataset

3.3.1 easy to classify/solve examples (for humans) from dataset

3.3.2 hard to classify/solve examples (for humans) from dataset
You can use your baseline model to find wrongly classified examples.


4. Deep Learning Models 

4.1 Baseline model performance (Simple Model)

This is the first basic model performance.
For this task:
please merge one example notebook from project page and hello-world notebook from course github site.

4.1.1 Model Introduction
a. Give one paragraph information about the model used
b. Use plot_model function to plot your model

4.1.1 Give figure of training loss vs validation loss

4.1.1 Give figure of training accuracy vs validation accuracy (or performance metrics used)

4.2 Model 2

4.2.1 Model Introduction
a. Give one paragraph information about the model used
b. Use plot_model function to plot your model

4.2.2 Give figure of training loss vs validation loss

4.2.3 Give figure of training accuracy vs validation accuracy (or performance metrics used)

4.3 Model 3

4.3.1 Model Introduction
a. Give one paragraph information about the model used
b. Use plot_model function to plot your model

4.3.2 Give figure of training loss vs validation loss

4.3.3 Give figure of training accuracy vs validation accuracy (or performance metrics used)
