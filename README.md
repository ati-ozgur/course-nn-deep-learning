## Lesson 01 Introduction to Python and Other Useful Tools for Machine Learning

We will use mostly jupyter notebooks but ability to debug python code is important skill to have.
Below is three best debuggers I used before.
Unfortunately Visual Studio is windows only but other two Wing IDE and PyCharm is cross platform.

1.1 Python IDEs

- [Wing IDE](https://wingware.com/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)

1.2 [Python tutorial](python-introduction.md)



1.3 [Ipython and Jupyter Notebooks](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.00-ipython-beyond-normal-python.html)

1.4 [Numpy tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)

1.5 [Pandas tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html)

1.6 [Visualization Matplotlib](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html)

You do not need to know everything about above subjects for our course but knowledge of jupyter notebooks, numpy, pandas and matplotlib are very important for machine learning engineers and data scientists.


## Lesson 02 Introduction to Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2.1 Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning


2.2 Machine Learning Toolbox examples

- scikit-Learn
- Weka 
- Matlab
- R Caret
- Of course others

2.3 Neural Network Frameworks

- Weka
- matlab
- [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/)

    "Encog continues to be developed, and is used in my own research, for areas that I need Java and are not covered by Keras. However, for larger-scale cutting edge work, where I do not need to implement the technology from scratch, I make use of Keras/TensorFlow for my own work."

2.4 Deep Learning Frameworks

Google Trends



- tensorflow
- keras
- pytorch
- mxnet
- [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/)
