## Deep Learning Toolboxes (Frameworks)


See one [comparison here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-framework-power-scores-2018-23607ddf297a).


We will use mxnet and gluon mostly due to availability of our course book.
It is a very good open book with jupyter notebooks, [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html).
