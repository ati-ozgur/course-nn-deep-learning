## Americas AI Action Plan Open source

- **Encourage Open-Source and Open-Weight AI**
- Open-source and open-weight AI models are made freely available by developers for anyone in the world to download and modify. 
- Models distributed this way have unique value for
innovation because startups can use them flexibly without being dependent on a closed model provider. 
- They also benefit commercial and government adoption of AI because many businesses and governments have sensitive data that they cannot send to closed model vendors. 
- And they are essential for academic research, which often relies on access to the weights and training data of a model to perform scientifically rigorous experiments.
- We need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values. 
- Open-source and open-weight models could become global standards in some areas of business and in academic research worldwide. 
- For that reason, they also have geostrategic value. While the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.
