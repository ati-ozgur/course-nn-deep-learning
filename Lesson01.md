# Lesson 01 Introduction to Python and Other Useful Tools for Machine Learning

## Python
There are a lot of excellent python tutorials in the web.
You may use any one of them.
Necessary [Python tutorial](python-introduction.md).

### Python IDE and Debuggers

We will use mostly jupyter notebooks but ability to debug python code is important skill to have.
Below is three best debuggers I have used before.
Unfortunately Visual Studio is windows only but other two Wing IDE and PyCharm is cross platform.
All of them have education licenses, you may apply for them.

- [Wing IDE](https://wingware.com/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)

## Data Science Tools

You do not need to know everything about following tools for our course but knowledge of jupyter notebooks, numpy, pandas and matplotlib are very important for machine learning engineers and data scientists.

### Jupyter

You need to have some jupyter notebook knowledge since most of the course contents will be in them.
In addition, your project report should be in jupyter notebook format.
Cheat sheet content is enough for our purposes.

For more information, There is an excellent tutorial for Jupyter from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) of Jake VanderPlas.

### Numpy 

Cheat sheet content is enough for our purposes.
