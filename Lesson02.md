## Lesson 02 Introduction to Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2.1 Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning


2.2 Machine Learning Toolbox examples

- scikit-Learn
- Weka 
- Matlab
- R Caret
- Of course others

2.3 Neural Network Frameworks

- Weka
- matlab
- [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/)

    "Encog continues to be developed, and is used in my own research, for areas that I need Java and are not covered by Keras. However, for larger-scale cutting edge work, where I do not need to implement the technology from scratch, I make use of Keras/TensorFlow for my own work."

2.4 Deep Learning Frameworks
