## Lesson 02 Introduction to Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2.1 Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning Examples

2.1.1 Supervised Learning Regression

2.1.2 Supervised Learning Classification




2.2 [Datasets](Datasets.md)

2.2.1 Train vs Test vs Validation dataset


2.3 Machine Learning Toolbox examples

- Scikit Learn
- Weka 
- Matlab
- R Caret
- Of course others

2.4 Neural Network Toolboxes

- Weka
- matlab
- [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/)

    "Encog continues to be developed, and is used in my own research, for areas that I need Java and are not covered by Keras. However, for larger-scale cutting edge work, where I do not need to implement the technology from scratch, I make use of Keras/TensorFlow for my own work."

2.5 Deep Learning Frameworks

See one [comparison here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-framework-power-scores-2018-23607ddf297a).


We will use mxnet and gluon mostly due to availability of our course book.
It is a very good open book with jupyter notebooks, [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html).
